The rise of large-scale data collection has generated a need for fast, reliable ways to analyze information. Cleaning, processing, and visualizing data has become a growing necessity in social science research. The R statistical programing environment offers a reliable, open-source, and costfree approach to data analysis. With a robust community of contributors, R allows for a wide range of different statistical analyses and data visualization approaches, making it the leading choice in data analytics.

This crash course will introduce incoming BSOS graduate students to the R programing environment in an effort to prepare them for their future methodological training in their respective programs. For many beginning users, manipulating and managing data in R can be frustrating. This course will focus on providing participants a basic knowledge of the R programming environment while simultaneously providing a practical data science toolkit that attendees can implement immediately. To this end, the course takes a ‘Tidyverse’ approach to R programming, which provides users an intuitive grammar for data manipulation. The goal is to provide a practical toolkit for analysis in R—without getting too bogged down in the nuts and bolts of functional programming—that they can then apply to their future academic training.

The course will take part across two 3-hour sessions. The first session will offer participants an underlying intuition of the R programming environment by focusing on the basics of (a) the syntax and environment, (b) data management, (c) graphics and presentation, and (d) modeling. Participants of the workshop will leave with an applied understanding of the R environment: specifically, importing and manipulating data, rendering graphics, presenting results, and implementing basic statistical models. The second session will focus on applied applications to different types of data science problems. This session intends to offer participants a general sense of what sorts of analyses and applications are possible in R.
