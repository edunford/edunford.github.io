title: "Making Great Slides with R Code"
output: ioslides_presentation
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Headers Set New slides

But the same markdown rules apply. 

- Bullet 1
- $\beta + \alpha$
- `r exp((4 + 6)/10)`

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

## Beamer (LaTex) or HTML?

If you prefer LaTex slides, just change the preamble to `beamer_presentation` instead of `ioslides_presentation`. It's that easy.
