Even when multiple event data sets are available, researchers tend to rely on only one. We instead advocate integrating information from multiple event data sets. The advantages include facilitating analysis of relationships between different types of conflict, providing more comprehensive empirical measurement, and evaluating the relative coverage and quality of data sets. Existing integration efforts have been performed manually, with significant limitations. Therefore, we introduce Matching Event Data by Location, Time and Type (MELTT)—an automated, transparent, reproducible methodology for integrating event data sets. For the cases of Nigeria 2011, South Sudan 2015, and Libya 2014, we show that using MELTT to integrate data from four leading conflict event data sets (Uppsala Conflict Data Project–Georeferenced Event Data, Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, Social Conflict Analysis Database, and Global Terrorism Database) provides a more complete picture of conflict. We also apply multiple systems estimation to show that each of these data sets has substantial missingness in coverage.","tags":["R Package","MELTT","Event Data","Conflict"],"title":"Integrating Conflict Event Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Waguespack","**Eric Dunford**","Johanna Birnir"],"categories":null,"date":1529294400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529294400,"objectID":"72b85e016a59875cb1b0c93994c1ea79","permalink":"/publication/cultural-imprinting/","publishdate":"2018-06-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cultural-imprinting/","section":"publication","summary":"Do firm founders from nations with more predictable and transparent institutions allocate more autonomy to their employees? A cultural imprinting view suggests that institutions inculcate beliefs that operate beyond the environment in which those beliefs originate. We leverage data from a multiplayer online role-playing game, EVE Online, a setting where individuals can establish and run their own corporations. EVE players come from around the world, but all face the same institutional environment within the game. This setting allows us to disentangle, for the first time, cultural norms from the myriad other local factors that will influence organizational design choices across nations. Our main finding is that founders residing in nations with more predictable and transparent real world institutions delegate more authority within the virtual firms they create.","tags":["Online Game Data","Institutions","Cultural Imprinting"],"title":"Cultural Imprinting, Institutions, and the Organization of New Firms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erik Melander","David Backer","**Eric Dunford**"],"categories":null,"date":1510117200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510117200,"objectID":"5e7b6b02f864518853bdaaf3e3b64a3e","permalink":"/publication/peace-and-conflict-2018/","publishdate":"2017-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/peace-and-conflict-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"In the previous edition of the Peace and Conflict book series, Donnay and Bhavnani (2016) highlighted the increasing availability and utilization of detailed event data as one of the noteworthy recent developments contributing to the cutting edge of research on peace and conflict. As an emergent common practice, these event data are both geocoded–identifying the coordinates of where each event occurred, most often pinpointing to a sub-national level and even a precise location–and date specific. This geographic and temporal granularity contrasts with conflict data that are reported with the country-, dyad-, or group-year as the unit of observation, on which many scholars in the field have traditionally relied. Thus, empirical studies using the existing event datasets have progressed to the stage of being well positioned to undertake more disaggregate analysis, employing study designs that reach closer to capturing where and when dynamics of conflict are actually theorized and ...","tags":["civil war","organized violence","UCDP","event data"],"title":"The Geography of Organized Armed Violence around the World","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1502942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502942400,"objectID":"0c44089485e67ad73c8352ce655c5952","permalink":"/talk/bsos-math-camp-2018/","publishdate":"2017-08-17T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/bsos-math-camp-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Slides for the talk can be found here\nThe rise of large-scale data collection has generated a need for fast, reliable ways to analyze information.

We take advantage of the known properties of the Generalized Friendship Paradox to measure the propagation rate of edge attributes (hashtags) in Twitter. We proceed to map the regions of political networks that are activated by different hashtags. We exemplify our strategy analyzing a large network in Brazil during the second half of 2015, the# Dilma mobilizations. Results show that government messages spread through a dense community of pro-government users that actively retweeted the content of a small set of politicians (network authorities). Meanwhile, opposition messages spread using a distributed network strategy, with very active network hubs coordinating their political messages.
