I am the **Associate Director** for the [Master of Science in Data Science for Public Policy program](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science-for-public-policy/) (DSPP), an **Assistant Teaching Professor** in the [McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) at **_Georgetown University_**, and a [**Computational Social Scientist** on the Core Data Science team](https://research.fb.com/people/dunford-eric/) at **_Facebook_**. 


My research interests lie at the intersection of political conflict, network science, and geographic information systems. My work examines the distribution and impact of political violence, extremism, and conspiracy theories on political and social systems. 

As a computational social scientist, I develop, utilize, and teach computational tools to help (a) effectively utilize computational methods to draw descriptive and causal inferences from data and (b) leverage non-traditional data assets to better understand social processes. 

<!-- I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park where I worked under the direction of [Johanna Birnir](https://gvpt.umd.edu/facultyprofile/birnir/j%C3%B3hanna), [David Cunningham](http://www.davidcunninghampolisci.com/), [Kathleen Cunningham](http://www.kathleengallaghercunningham.com/), and [Ernesto Calvo](http://gvptsites.umd.edu/calvo/).  -->
