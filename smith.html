        <h2><font color="steelblue" > Overview </font></h2>

        <p> This short course will take place across two sessions. Each session will be approximately 2 hours in length and will offer an introduction to the R statistical programing language. All sessions will include slides and example code to accompany the materials being presented. Attendees need only bring a personal computer to follow along. No prior statistical or computer programming knowledge is needed to benefit from the course, but the assumption is that most users are familiar with statistics and STATA and are looking to expand their programming toolkit.</p>
        <p> The course will offer attendees an underlying intuition of the R programming environment by focusing on (a) data management, and (b) graphics and presentation. Attendees of the workshop will leave with an applied understanding of the R environment: specifically, importing and manipulating data, rendering graphics, presenting results, and implementing a range of statistical models.This course will focus on providing attendees a basic knowledge of the R programming environment while simultaneously providing a practical data science toolkit that attendees can implement immediately. To this end, the course takes a ‘Tidyverse’ approach to R programming, which provides users an intuitive grammar for data manipulation. The goal is to provide a practical toolkit for analysis in R without getting too bogged down in the nuts and bolts of functional programming.</p>

        <h2><font color="steelblue">Session 1: R Basics</font></h2>

        <p> The focus of the first day is to get R up and running, and to cover the basics of the object-oriented language by focusing on different data structures. In addition, we will cover how to import and export different kinds of data, download packages, and view data. From there, we'll look at the operations and cleaning text in R.This initial session will be foundational in getting situated with the R programming environment.</p>
