## Live Simulated Environments

Recent work in the social sciences demonstrate the value of virtual worlds in analyzing social and collective behavior. Online video games provide useful "petri dishes" for the study of collective and normative behavior (Castronova and Falk, 2009; Williams, 2010) by offering researchers highly granular event data (second-by-second) of player actions, a wealth of structural breaks ideal for natural experiments (when rules of the game are changed or new servers are activated), and clear ways to operationalize individual-level capacity, motivations, and resources (Williams et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2009; Kahn and Williams, 2015; Keegan et al., 2010). We refer to these data as live simulated environments: an environment where human agents react to simulated conditions.

Live simulated environments offer a rare opportunity to examine individual and group-level behavior in a way that was previously impossible. First, these data offer a perfect record of all activity. As all player information is recorded, one can observe a player’s entrance and exit from groups, evolution of behavior over time, and degree of cooperation and conﬂict. Second, group dynamics can be recomposed. Individual-level interactions of members in a group can be perfectly tracked and mapped. As a result, group networks can be reconstructed, and exact measurements of cohesion and interaction can be captured over time. Third, changes in the environment can be leveraged for causal identiﬁcation. Specifically, when rules are changed in the game, this produces a structural break that can yield discontinuities in individual and group-level behavior for casual identification.

My co-authors (David Waguespack and Johanna Birnir) and I use a massive multiplayer online game, [Eve Online (EVE)](https://www.eveonline.com/). EVE was created in 2003 by [CCP Games](https://www.ccpgames.com/) and plays out in an interstellar backdrop where individuals mine resources, barter and trade, compete over territory, and wage large-scale conﬂicts. The game has a total user-base of 600,000+ individuals, spanning 163 countries, 65 of which have more than 5,000 users. In the game, users ﬂy around in ships that are purchased and created by acquiring resources during game play. The game is stylistically modeled as a “sandbox”, which is a style of game in which minimal limitations are placed on the user. This allows individuals to roam, interact, cheat, trick, and shape the virtual universe. 

EVE functions as a live simulated environment given four underlying assumptions that underpin its game play. 

- **The environment is market-based**: Resources in the game need to be mobilized. Capacity in the virtual world is deﬁned by an agent’s ability to gain sufficient funds to buy “ships,” generate incentives to coordinate players, and project power. Extraction and exchange require goods to be brought to market, which which can be looted when transported or may lack buyers when brought to market. Thus, the market-based system generates uncertainty, risk, and requires strategic calculation in order to gain resources. Moreover, it makes the loss of resources costly, as gaining back losses takes considerable time and energy.

- **The game pivots off collective action**: The game requires players to coordinate their activity, to pool resources, and to monitor each other for free riding and other infractions. Players enter into corporations, which have a distinct hierarchies and leadership structures. In addition, corporations can join into alliances, which yield considerable inﬂuence on the dynamics in the game. The underlying need for players in different countries, time zones, and backgrounds to coordinate offers a rare but valuable microcosm of collective activity.

- **The environment offers a realistic approximation of risk**: Assets take time to acquire and can be permanently destroyed. Poor decisions, mismanagement, and adverse random occurrences (bad luck) can result in the lose of valuable resources. Extraction and acquisition of resources in the game takes considerable time, and thus loss of these resources carries meaning for players. This reality is reﬂected in the in-game adage: “don’t ﬂy what you can’t afford to lose.” Players often need to transport large quantities of resources, or utilize expensive weapons in decisive battles that open them up to risk. This risk conditions how players play, and the decisions they make.

- **The environment pivots off territorial control**: Territory can only be acquired and maintained given sufficient capacity and manpower. This means that alliances between corporations must be maintained in order to retain territory --- as the alliance’s military capacity is only good as the sum of all member corporation’s capabilities. The reality of territorial control requires agreements and negotiations between groups; it requires that players mobilize and come online when the alliance faces a challenger; and it requires that resources be sufficiently distributed between partner corporations.

We use these data to examine a range of political science and business management questions.

## Working Papers

- "<a href="" target="_blank">Gender Norms and Violent Behavior in a Virtual World</a>"<blockquote>How does gender influence violent behavior? Existing research generally focuses on biological and contextual factors that drive variation in violence, often overlooking how internalized gender norms can influence violent actions. Isolating the effect of norms from biology is challenging because sex and gender are typically conﬂated. Moreover, it is difficult to observe and know if individuals behave the same publicly as opposed to privately. To get around these issues, we examine a novel multi-player computer game setting where players can operate characters of varying genders, thus holding biology constant. The data tracks more than 488,000 unique players from over 150 countries for their first 30 days of gameplay. By exploiting variation in game mechanics, we ﬁnd evidence that behavioral differences are attributable to internalized norms as opposed to biology or external sanctioning. We then leverage a natural experiment in the data to examine if these internalized norms can be altered. We find that both male and female players utilize their female characters more violently when exposed to examples of females in military roles. The project is the first to distinguish the effects of gender norms from the effects of biology or social sanctioning---conﬁrming the importance of gender norms while clarifying the differences these norms exert on men and women’s behavior.</blockquote>

Birnir). _Strategic Science._<blockquote>Do firm founders from nations with more predictable and transparent institutions allocate more autonomy to their employees? A cultural imprinting view suggests that institutions inculcate beliefs that operate beyond the environment in which those beliefs originate. We leverage data from a multiplayer online role-playing game, EVE Online, a setting where individuals can establish and run their own corporations. EVE players come from around the world, but all face the same institutional environment within the game. This setting allows us to disentangle, for the first time, cultural norms from the myriad other local factors that will influence organizational design choices across nations. Our main finding is that founders residing in nations with more predictable and transparent real world institutions delegate more authority within the virtual firms they create.</blockquote></details>
