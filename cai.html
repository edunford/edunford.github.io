        <h1> <font face="garamond"> An Introduction To Statistical Programing In R </font> </h1>
        Instructor: Eric Dunford &diams; [Email](edunford@umd.edu) &diams; Syllabus &diams; April 3 - 7, 2017
        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > Overview </font> </h2>
        <p> The rise of large-scale data collection has generated a need for fast, reliable ways to analyze information. Cleaning, processing, and visualizing data has become a growing necessity in analytic and consulting work. The R statistical programing environment offers a reliable, open-source, and cost-free approach to data analysis. With a robust community of contributors, R allows for all types of statistical analysis and data visualization, making it the leading choice in data analytics. </p>
        <p> The goal of this 5 day short course is to offer attendees an underlying intuition of the R programming environment by focusing on (a) data management, (b) basic statistical analysis, and (c) graphics and presentation. Attendees of the workshop will leave with an applied understanding of the R environment: specifically, importing and manipulating data, creating and deleting variables, rendering graphics and maps, managing and analyzing text, and common descriptive and statistical analytic methods.</p>
        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > DAY 1: The Basics of R </font> </h2>
        <p> The focus of the first day is to get R up and running, and to cover the basics of the object-oriented language by focusing on different data structures. In addition, we will cover how to import and export different kinds of data, download packages, and view data. This initial session will be foundational in getting situated with the R programming environment.  </p>
