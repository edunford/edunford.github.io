        <h1> An Introduction To Statistical Programing In R </h1>
        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > ABOUT </font> </h2>
        <p> The rise of large-scale data collection has generated a need for fast, reliable ways to analyze information. Cleaning, processing, and visualizing data has become a growing necessity in analytic and consulting work. The R statistical programing environment offers a reliable, open-source, and cost-free approach to data analysis. With a robust community of contributors, R allows for all types of statistical analysis and data visualization, making it the leading choice in data analytics. </p>
        <p> The goal of this 5 day short course is to offer attendees an underlying intuition of the R programming environment by focusing on (a) data management, (b) basic statistical analysis, and (c) graphics and presentation. Attendees of the workshop will leave with an applied understanding of the R environment: specifically, importing and manipulating data, creating and deleting variables, rendering graphics and maps, managing and analyzing text, and common descriptive and statistical analytic methods.</p>
