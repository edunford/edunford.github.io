        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > Overview </font> </h2>
        <p> The rise of large-scale data collection has generated a need for fast, reliable ways to analyze information. Cleaning, processing, and visualizing data has become a growing necessity in analytic and consulting work. The R statistical programing environment offers a reliable, open-source, and cost-free approach to data analysis. With a robust community of contributors, R allows for all types of statistical analysis and data visualization, making it the leading choice in data analytics. </p>
        <p> The goal of this 5 day short course is to offer attendees an underlying intuition of the R programming environment by focusing on (a) data management, (b) basic statistical analysis, and (c) graphics and presentation. Attendees of the workshop will leave with an applied understanding of the R environment: specifically, importing and manipulating data, creating and deleting variables, rendering graphics and maps, managing and analyzing text, and common descriptive and statistical analytic methods.</p>
        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > DAY 1: The Basics of R </font> </h2>
        <p> The focus of the first day is to get R up and running, and to cover the basics of the object-oriented language by focusing on different data structures. In addition, we will cover how to import and export different kinds of data, download packages, and view data. This initial session will be foundational in getting situated with the R programming environment.  </p>

        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > DAY 2: Data Management in R</font> </h2>
        <p> The second day will focus on operations in R, creating and deleting variables, merging and filtering data, and cleaning text and dates. We will place particular emphasis on using the <i>dplyr</i> package in R for data management. </p>
        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > DAY 3: Graphics and Maps</font> </h2>
        <p> The third day will focus on graphics with emphasis on the base graphics functions in R and the <i>ggplot2</i> package. The workshop will cover general summary plots (e.g. barplots, scatterplots, violin plots, etc.) along with more advanced plotting needs, such as maps. </p>
        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > DAY 4: Analysis and Presentation </font> </h2>
        <p> The fourth day will focus on performing general analysis in R. We will focus on data summary techniques, such as summary statistics, cross-tabs, correlations, histograms and scatterplots. From there, the workshop will cover a range of common statistical analyses: difference of means, regression, principal component and factor analysis, reliability scores, and basic text analysis. Past training in statistics will help but is not necessary to follow the material. The workshop will then go into efficient ways to present an export data analysis as PDF, HTML or Word documents using R Notebooks. </p>
        <h2> <font color="steelblue" > DAY 5: Open</font> </h2>
        <p> The final day will be left open to catch up on any remaining material, reviewing concepts, and covering materials and concepts attendees wish to know. </p>
